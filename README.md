# Using Topic Models For Visualization of Short News Texts

This is a part of a final project for an introductory course in data science. In our project we analyzed news metadata from the New York Times to gain some insights, using the tools we learned in class. This part, which I was in charge of, is mostly about visualizing trends in news reporting, and about finding the tools that could help us describe the data in a meaningful way. The focus here was learning the theoretical background of topic models & the differences between a few of them, fitting them to the data and finally visualizing the results.

We chose to focus on a general topic and then visualize the trends in its subtopics. Specifically, the topic was Trump's presidency. Here are examples for the results of the visualization:
